Aircraft Trajectory Planning With Collision Avoidance Using Mixed Integer Linear Programming by Arthur Richards and Jonathan P. How (10.1109/ACC.2002.1023918)
---


This is an attempt to reproduce the aforementioned paper by using CVXPY as the main framework.

There are several solvers (mixed-integer linear programming) that can be used, such as: SCIP, SCIPY, GLPK_MI, CBC, MOSEK, GUROBI and CPLEX.

Each of these solvers may give different results.
